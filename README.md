# FaceMaskDetection


1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered a dataset consisting of facial images with and without masks. Ensured a diverse set of images are used to improve the model's generalization.

2. **Data Labeling:**
   - Manually labeled each image in the dataset as either "with mask" or "without mask."
   - 
3. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to artificially increase the size of the dataset. This helped the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

4. **Face Detection:**
   - Used a pre-trained face detection model to identify and extract faces from the images. This step helps focus the model on relevant regions, making it more efficient.

5. **Cropping:**
   - Cropped the images to include only the facial region. This reduces unnecessary information and enhances the model's ability to learn facial features relevant to mask detection.

6. **Resizing:**
   - Resized the cropped facial images to a standardized size. This ensures consistency in input dimensions for the neural network and facilitates faster training.

7. **Normalization:**
   - Normalized pixel values to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]) to ensure numerical stability during training. This step aids in faster convergence and better model performance.

8. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set helps tune hyperparameters, and the test set evaluates the model's generalization on unseen data.

9. **Model Architecture:**
   - Designed the CNN architecture for face mask detection. Typically, this involves stacking convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Batch normalization and dropout layers were included to improve performance and prevent overfitting.

10. **Model Training:**
    - Trained the CNN using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to identify patterns and features that distinguish between faces with and without masks.

11. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluated the trained model using the validation set to assess its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

12. **Testing:**
    - Tested the final model on the test set to assess its generalization to unseen data. This step helps ensure the model's reliability in real-world scenarios.
